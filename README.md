## Project Purpose

The weight of loss is profound, and the celebration of life often remains in the shadows. I want to bring light to the lives of those we've loved and lost through a community-driven project.

I believe an Open Source website will fit this mission the best; OSS websites are easily accessible and easy to contribute to. This website will be a place where people can share pictures, stories, and other meaningful details—such as the cause of death—to -- all to honor and remember those who have passed. Being able to share stories, pictures, and more with others in a space built on support, I believe, offers and invaluable resource to the community.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Q & A

Q. Why not a non-coding framework for the website's development?  
A. Because they're often limited in their capabilities. I don't mind picking up whatever extra work is necessary. We also compromise with React because it's the most popular framework, meaning more people can contribute to it if they'd like to.

Q. Why not this other framework or this other hosting service?  
A. I chose NextJS, Vercel, and Shadcn because a lot of people are very familiar with it, it's easy to get off the ground, and it will not lose support anytime soon. There's also not a lot this stack can't do. 

## Funding

Frankly, Vercel will cover the bill for a long time. When it gets to the point where it starts costing money, then a community discussion can be had. This discussion will almost certainly be held in the Discord, and any other location where the conversation is being had will not be monitored. Please make your voice heard! (In a respectful way)
