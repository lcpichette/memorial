You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Community

We understand that building and engaging with a memorial website can be both a deeply personal and technical journey. To support you, we’ve created a community where you can find assistance, share stories, and connect with others.

### Join Our Discord

Our Discord server is a safe space where you can:

    Get emotional support: Share your feelings or just connect with others who understand.
    Seek technical help: Ask questions about setting up your website, troubleshooting, or customizing your experience.
    Share and learn: Exchange ideas, resources, and tips with other community members.

### Disclaimer

While we strive to make the community a safe and supportive space:

- Emotional Support: The community is not a substitute for professional mental health services. If you're in need of immediate help, we strongly encourage you to contact a qualified professional or a crisis hotline.
- Respect and Kindness: All members are expected to engage with empathy, respect, and kindness. Any harmful or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
- Technical Support: Advice provided by community members is offered voluntarily and may not always address your specific issue. Please exercise your own judgment.

By joining, you agree to follow the community guidelines and help maintain a welcoming and supportive atmosphere for everyone.

## Funding

Frankly, Vercel will cover the bill for a long time. When it gets to the point where it starts costing money, then a community discussion can be had. This discussion will almost certainly be held in the Discord, and any other location where the conversation is being had will not be monitored. Please make your voice heard! (In a respectful way)
